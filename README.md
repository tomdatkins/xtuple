#Proprietary extensions for the xTuple platform

Thank you for your interest in building an extension for the xTuple web/mobile platform!
Here's how you do it.

1. Fork github.com/xtuple/private-extensions
2. Copy the template to your extension name
<code><pre>
  cp -r source/template source/foo
<pre></code>
3. Fill in everything.


To build all the private extensions for xTuple Postbooks, run the ./tools/buildExtensions.sh 
script. All the resultant js and css files will be saved in the builds/ directory
